# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/json/
        - assets/images/sfondi/
        - assets/unmute.mp3
        - assets/refresh.mp3
        - assets/mattina.mp3
        - assets/grilli.mp3
        - assets/logo.png

    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Arapey
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Arapey-Regular.ttf
